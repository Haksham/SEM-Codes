Q.3A
Consider the Aircraft database given below. The primary keys are
underlined. Assume relevant data types for attributes.
AIRCRAFT (Aircraft ID, Aircraft_name, Cruising_range)
CERTIFIED (Emp ID, Aircraft ID)
EMPLOYEE (Emp ID, Ename, Salary)
Create the above tables in SQL. Specify primary and foreign keys properly.
Enter at least 5 tuples in each table with relevant data. Solve the following
queries.
i. Find the employee IDâ€™s of employee who make the highest salary.
ii. Find the name of aircrafts such that all pilots certified to operate them earn more than 50000
iii. Find the employees who are not certified for operating any aircraft.

Create table aircraft(aid varchar(9) primary key,aname varchar(10),crange int);
Create table employees(eid varchar(9) primary key,ename varchar(10),salary int);
Create table certified(eid varchar(9)references employees(eid),aid varchar(9)references aircraft(aid));

insert into aircraft values('B001','Boeing',4000);
insert into employees values(1,'Johnny',40000);
insert into certified values(1,'B001');

SELECT eid FROM employees WHERE salary=(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);

SELECT distinct aname FROM aircraft a,certified c,employees e WHERE a.aid=c.aid and c.eid=e.eid and e.salary>50000;

select ename,max(a.aid) from employees e,certified c,aircraft a where e.eid=c.eid and a.aid=c.aid;
